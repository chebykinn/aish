# Intelligent Shell Script Example

This is an example of our new intelligent markdown scripting system. The shell can now process markdown paragraphs as LLM actions.

Let's start by creating a simple test file and then analyzing it.

```bash
echo "Hello from aish shell!" > test_output.txt
ls -la test_output.txt
```

Now read the file we just created into the context for analysis.

Read file test_output.txt

Analyze the content we just loaded and explain what this demonstrates about our shell's capabilities.

Let's clear the context and demonstrate more functionality.

Clear context

Add this information to context: Our shell now supports intelligent markdown processing with LLM integration.

```bash
echo "Context cleared and new information added"
```

## Summary

This script demonstrates the integration of:
- Traditional shell commands in code blocks
- LLM-powered paragraph processing
- Context management across script execution
- Intelligent analysis and explanation capabilities
