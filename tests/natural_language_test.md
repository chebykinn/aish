# Natural Language Tool Calling Test

This script tests the improved natural language processing where the LLM decides when to call tools based on context, not keyword parsing.

Let's create a test configuration file to work with.

```bash
echo '{"database": {"host": "localhost", "port": 5432}, "app": {"name": "MyApp"}}' > test_config.json
```

Now I'd like you to please read the test_config.json file so we can analyze it.

Could you help me understand what's in the database configuration? Please analyze the content.

The word "explaining" appears here, but it shouldn't trigger any tool because it's just part of normal text explaining the test.

Please clear our context and start fresh.

Add this note to our context: "Testing completed successfully"

```bash
echo "All tests completed"
rm -f test_config.json
```

This demonstrates that the LLM can understand natural language requests without requiring specific keywords.
